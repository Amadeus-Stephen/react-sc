# react-sc
a task manager that uses , sockets, reactjs, nodejs, axios, passport , mongodb , and express 
this also happends to be the first time i decide to to be dumb , and use a tradisional folder structure :) 


to run the backend cd into the folder and use "npm run dev" in the terminal for nodemon or use can just use "npm start"

for the frontend react app just use "npm start"
